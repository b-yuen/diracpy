Welcome to Diracpy's documentation!
===================================

Diracpy, offers a robust API empowering developers to
effortlessly craft and resolve quantum models with precision, using a
syntax rooted in Dirac notation. Within this API lie pivotal classes for
articulating quantum states and operators, along with pre-defined quantum
systems. Moreover, it furnishes functions to seamlessly transform and solve
these systems.

Diracpy transcends mere API functionality. It boasts an extensive
collection of methods, designed to tackle quantum dynamics with
efficiency and versatility. The true strength of diracpy lies in
its ability to liberate developers from the complexities of implementation.
By enabling quantum models to be articulated in a succinct, abstract manner
using state vectors and operators, diracpy deftly handles the intricate
groundwork: from constructing suitable bases to adeptly vectorizing and
ultimately solving the equations of motion.
